        4.  The Project Management Committee may take a decision at any time to grant, restrict or remove a Committer's access rights to one or more repositories and/or online services of the Project, in accordance with the Charter of the TGC.

        5.  Any natural person may achieve the status of Committer through the following process.

        6.  A Contributor to the Project decides to become a Committer and contacts an existing Committer for mentorship, or a Committer identifies a Contributor who has the potential to become a Committer and proposes this to that Contributor.

        7.  The Committer informs the Project Management Committee for that Project of their intention to take on a new Contributor for mentorship towards being a Committer for specific repositories of the Project. The Project Management Committee may, by discussion and a resolution, choose to reject the proposed mentorship.

        8.  The Contributor and the mentoring Committer ("Mentor") work together over a period of not less than sixth calendar months and not more than one calendar year, with the goal of the Contributor learning what is required in being a Committer, making further and more significant contributions to the Project, gaining the necessary experience to be able to perform the Committer role independently, and demonstrating their ability to perform the role correctly and in keeping with the policies of the Project, as specified by the Project Management Committee, and the policies of the OSRA, as specified by the TGC.

        9.  At a point no less than sixth calendar months after commencing the mentorship, the Mentor proposes to the Project Management Committee that the Contributor be promoted to a Committer for the repositories of the Project specified at the start of the mentorship, and receive all rights conducive with that position. The Project Management Committee shall discuss the proposal, followed by the Project Leader taking a decision via consensus or a vote on whether to accept or reject the Contributor as a Committer.

        10. If the Mentor cannot propose to the Project Management Committee that the Contributor be promoted to Committer status within one calendar year of commencing the mentorship, or the Project Management Committee does not accept the Contributor within one calendar year of the mentorship commencing, then the mentorship terminates. In this situation, the Contributor and/or the Mentor are free to begin the process again at any time, including with a different Committer fulfilling the role of Mentor.

        11. There shall be no requirement to be a Supporting Individual Member of the OSRA to become a Committer.

        13. Working Groups shall report to the Project Management Committee at a frequency defined in the Charter of the Working Group.
