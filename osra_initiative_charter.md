        1.  The OSRA allows membership-based participation in the initiative by organisations and natural persons.

        2.  The OSRA has six (6) classes of membership: (1) Platinum; (2) Gold; (3) Silver; (4) Associate; (5) Supporting Organisation; and (6) Supporting Individual. As used herein, the term Member may be used to refer generically to a Platinum Member, Gold Member, Silver Member, Associate Member, Supporting Organisation Member or Supporting Individual Member. The Platinum, Gold and Silver Members shall be collectively referred to as the Sponsoring Members. The Associate, Supporting Organisation and Supporting Individual Members shall be collectively referred to as the Non-Sponsoring Members. All membership classes except for the Supporting Individual class shall be collectively referred to as the Organisation Members. All six (6) classes of membership shall be collectively referred to as the Members.

        3.  Provided they remain Members in good standing as one of Platinum, Gold or Silver membership class, Inaugural Members shall be denoted as founding members on the OSRF's websites for the OSRA and relevant promotional material.

        4.  The OSRA shall maintain a membership record containing the name and address of each Member and the date upon which the applicant became a Member. Termination of the membership of any Member shall be recorded in the record, together with the date of termination of such membership.

        5.  Each Platinum Member, Gold Member, Silver Member and Associate Member shall designate one (1) natural person authorised to vote and otherwise act on its behalf within the OSRA (the "Member Representative"). The Member Representative shall represent the Member's interests and not that natural person's individual interests.

            A Member may change its Member Representative at any time by giving written notice by e-mail to the Secretary of the OSRF or his or her delegate in the OSRA.

            A Member may designate in writing by e-mail to the Secretary of the OSRF or his or her delegate in the OSRA a substitute representative to exercise the Member's voting rights at any Meeting at which the Member has voting rights.

Except in the case of expulsion of a Member, within ten (10) days of end of Membership within the OSRA, a Member may appeal in writing to the Board for a pro rata refund of its Annual Membership Fee. The appeal will specifically set forth any circumstances that the Member believes justify a refund in its case. The Board shall decide by simple majority of the directors present, represented or participating remotely in the meeting upon the appeal in its sole discretion at its first meeting following the appeal scheduled according to 12.3 of this Charter.

    11. Membership Fees -- Dues

        1.  In order to achieve the Purpose of the OSRF, the Members will be required to pay an annual membership fee (the "Annual Membership Fee") and other dues as set forth in the Open Source Robotics Alliance Initiative Membership Agreement, as amended from time to time by the Board. The amount of the Annual Membership Fee is determined by the Board on the basis of (i) the respective membership class of the Member, (ii) reasonable and non-discriminatory criteria for determining fee variation within a class as approved by the Board, and (iii) for Organization Members, the type of organization/company the Member belongs to. For clarity, the Annual Membership Fee and the other dues owed by each Member will be based on the total aggregate size of its Control Group.

        2.  Each Member shall have to pay the respective Annual Membership Fee and other dues, as determined, by the deadline fixed by the Board. The Secretary will send out invoices in compliance with reasonable invoicing requirements (e.g. receipt of invoices at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date). The Secretary will promptly send out a written notice to any Member that has not paid its Annual Membership Fee or other dues within thirty (30) days after the date upon which such Annual Membership Fee and other dues are required to be paid. Upon receipt of the written notice, the Member's rights, including, where relevant, voting rights, shall be deemed suspended until all delinquent Annual Membership Fees and dues are paid. A Member is not in good standing if its dues have not been paid within the time required.

    12. Antitrust

        1.  Each Member acknowledges that the Members are committed to fostering competition in the development of new products and services and that the OSRF's activities and the Projects of the OSRF are intended to promote and support such competition. The Members further acknowledge that some of them may compete with one another in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Members acknowledge that the Members that are competitors shall not discuss issues relating to absolute or particular product costs, product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, any division of markets, or allocation of customers or any other topic that would be prohibited by applicable antitrust laws. Accordingly, each Member hereby assumes responsibility to provide appropriate legal counsel to its representatives acting according to this Charter regarding the importance of limiting their discussions to subjects that relate to the purpose of the OSRA and/or the OSRF, whether or not such discussions take place during formal meetings, informal gatherings, or otherwise.

        2.  Each Member consents to the OSRF's giving notice of Member's membership in the OSRA, to the extent necessary for the OSRF to invoke the protection of the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993. (15 U.S.C. §§4301 et seq.), if the Corporation decides to invoke such protection.

        14. The Project Governance Structure for a Project shall be defined in the Charter for that Project.

        15. Each Project Governance Structure shall be treated individually.

        16. An identical Project Governance Structure may be used for two (2) or more Projects, but each Project shall have its own instance of that Project Governance Structure and all involved venues.

    4.  Project Leader

        1.  A Project shall have one (1) Project Leader.

        2.  The Project Leader shall have responsibilities towards the Project and towards the TGC that include, but may not be limited to, the following:

        3.  organize and hold meetings of the Project Management Committee for their Project;

        4.  coordinate the work of the Project Management Committee in achieving the goals of the Project; and

        5.  represent the Project on the TGC, including providing the position of the Project in regard to discussions held, decisions being taken, and resolutions being made; casting the vote of the Project in decision making; and providing reports on the activities of the Project Management Committee for their Project.

        6.  A Project Leader shall serve for a term of one (1) calendar year, commencing at midnight on the 1^st^ of January and ending at midnight on the 1^st^ of January of the following calendar year.

        7.  A Project Leader may serve multiple terms, including consecutively and non-consecutively.

        8.  Prior to being nominated to be the Project Leader for a Project, the relevant natural person must be a PMC Member for that same Project and must have had that status continuously for a minimum of one (1) calendar year. To be nominated, the PMC Member must demonstrate access to the necessary resources (including time) to be able to lead the Project effectively and proactively.

        9.  The Project Leader is selected and emplaced through the following process.

        10. At least three weeks prior to the TGC meeting closest to the end of the term of the current Project Leader, but still within the active period of the current Project Leader, the PMC Members discuss, either in a closed meeting of the Project Management Committee or via asynchronous electronic communication, candidates for the next Project Leader. PMC Members are encouraged, but not required, to consult Committers of the Project who are not PMC Members.

        11. The PMC Members take a decision to nominate one of their number to be the next Project Leader by 16 calendar days prior to the TGC meeting closest to the end of the term of the current Project Leader, but still within the active period of the current Project Leader. The decision shall be taken using a method specified in the Project Management Committee's Charter.

        12. The current Project Leader provides to the Chair of the TGC the name of the nominated PMC Member and the arguments for and against that nominee and requests a hearing in the next TGC meeting to confirm or reject the nomination. Statements on the nominee from other PMC Members of the same Project may also be provided to the TGC by the Project Leader or by any PMC Member directly. A statement may be named or anonymous at the discretion of the PMC Member providing the statement.

        13. The Project Leader presents the nominee in the relevant TGC meeting. The nominee is invited to attend this TGC meeting in order to state their case for being the next Project Leader.

        14. The TGC takes a decision on whether to confirm or reject the nominee.

        15. If the TGC confirms the nominee, that nominee becomes the Project Leader on the following 1^st^ of January.

        16. If the TGC rejects the nominee, the current Project Leader's term is extended until the next TGC meeting, and the Project Management Committee is requested to provide an alternative nominee, or counterarguments against the TGC's reasons for rejecting the original nominee. The TGC then holds further discussion and takes a decision at its earliest convenience. This process shall repeat until the TGC confirms a new Project Leader; the new Project Leader shall start their term immediately, but their term shall only run until the end of the current calendar year.

        17. Should the TGC reject the nominated PMC Member, and the Project Management Committee fails to provide an alternative nominee, the TGC is not required to limit its choice to the PMC Member nominated by the Project Management Committee. In the case in which a non-PMC Member is selected by a decision of the TGC, the TGC must obtain ratification of its decision by a simple majority of the Board.

        18. The Technical Governance Committee may remove the Project Leader at any time by a resolution of the TGC at its sole discretion, or when required to do so by a resolution of the Board. Upon removal of the Project Leader, that Project Leader's term terminates immediately and the TGC selects a PMC Member of the same Project to be an interim Project Leader while the process of choosing a new Project Leader proceeds, following 36.6 of this Charter. The removed Project Leader may appeal their removal to the TGC and/or the Board.

        19. If, at any time, the Project Leader position is unfilled, the Technical Governance Committee may select a PMC Member to be an Interim Project Leader while the process of choosing a new Project Leader proceeds. The Interim Project Leader may serve until the end of the current calendar year, or up to six (6) calendar months, whichever is longer.

        20. If the Project Leader position remains unfilled continuously for one full year, the Technical Governance Committee shall suspend the Project.
