# Policies and Procedures of Technical Governance of the Open Source Robotics Foundation

Effective as of XX March 2024.

## Introduction

This document defines the policies and procedures ("P&P") used by the Open Source Robotics Foundation ("OSRF") to govern those projects that it has placed under the technical governance of its Open Source Robotics Alliance Initiative ("OSRA").
Additional policies and procedures may be defined in other documents as specified by this document or the [Policies and Procedures Index document]() ("P&P Index").
The policies and procedures in this and all other P&P documents may be changed by a vote of the Board of Directors as the needs and purposes of the OSRA change.
These policies and procedures are considered binding rules of the OSRA, and an addition to the articles and clauses of the OSRA Charter.

> ℹ️ Paragraphs offset from the body text in the manner of this paragraph are explanations, rationales, or other informative text.
> They are not binding rules governing the operation of the OSRA Initiative.
> They are included in order to better convey the intent of this document.

## Purpose of the OSRA


The purpose of the OSRA, as defined in the Charter of the Open Source Robotics Alliance, is as follows.

> The Open Source Robotics Alliance (“OSRA”) is a charitable program of the Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc. (“OSRF”), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”).
> Subject to the control of the OSRF Board of Directors (the “Board”), the specific charitable purpose of the OSRA is to support, promote, protect and organize open-source software for robotic systems, and related activities that:
>
> 1. sustain and evolve certain projects of the OSRF and surrounding software ecosystem(s) over time in response to changes in technology and the needs and requests of the user community;
> 1. provide technical oversight, in a vendor-neutral way, of certain projects of the OSRF;
> 1. support the provision of computing, network, storage and human resources to any project of the OSRF that has a bona fide requirement for such resources;
> 1. support the development and hosting of vendor-neutral specifications related to or relevant to the projects of the OSRF, including maintaining publicly accessible online repositories of these specifications;
> 1. support the maintenance of publicly accessible online repositories of certain projects of the OSRF and related documents, reference materials, and reports; and
> 1. further any achievement of OSRA’s charitable purposes.

In short, the purpose of the OSRA is to govern specific open-source projects of the OSRF for the good of the community as a whole over the long term, in the pursuit of fulfilling the goals of the OSRF.
The policies and procedures of the OSRA are designed and intended to enable the smooth achievement of this purpose in a fair and equitable way that gives all members of the community of users and contributors a voice.
The policies and procedures define how all committees and groups of the OSRA operate to ensure this smooth operation and avoid unnecessary delays in decision making, while still providing sufficient time for debate and consideration.

## ARTICLE 2. Technical Governance Committee

### ARTICLE 2.1 General

This section describes the policies and procedures of the Technical Governance Committee ("TGC").
This includes both the TGC itself and subcommittees thereof.

> ℹ️ The TGC is an "advisory committee to the Board" (the Board of Directors of the OSRF) under the OSRF's Bylaws.
> This means that it is formed for the specific purposes defined in the OSRA Charter and the Board has oversight of its activities.

The TGC is responsible for oversight of the Project Management Committees, ensuring that each Project is managed appropriately with respect to the goals of the Project and the goals of the OSRF.
In addition to this, the TGC is expected to undertake technical activities to improve the operation of all Projects.

> ℹ️ Examples of technical activities undertaken by the TGC are developing acceptable quality assurance standards and processes for Projects to use, and developing enhancement proposal processes.

### ARTICLE 2.2 Composition

The Technical Governance Committee is composed of a mix of paying OSRA members, representatives of projects, and delegates from the OSRF.
The specific composition of the TGC at any one time will vary depending on the number and class of paying members.
It is the responsibility of the Chair of the TGC to manage the number of TGC Members and ensure each position is filled, when and if possible.




### ARTICLE 2.3 Role of the Chair of the TGC

The Chair of the TGC is selected by the Board of Directors of the OSRF.
They are responsible for the overall operation of the TGC, including organising and running all TGC meetings, directing the technical activities of the TGC, and reporting to the Board of the OSRF on TGC activities.

When the Chair of the TGC is unavailable, their designee (who may be selected by the Board, as appropriate and in line with Article 4 of the OSRA Charter) shall act in their steed.


### ARTICLE 2.4 Meetings

The TGC shall hold a regular meeting once per calendar month.
Additional meetings may be held within a calendar month when any of the following occurs:

1. The Chair of the TGC calls a special meeting, and provides an agenda and a sufficient notice period.

1. A voting TGC Member makes a request for a special meeting to the Chair of the TGC, after which the Chair shall call the meeting following all required notice and agenda requirements.

A TGC meeting may only last as long as originally scheduled when notice was sent by the Chair.
No actions or decisions may be taken once the scheduled meeting end time has passed, unless all TGC Members unanimously agree to extend the meeting.


### ARTICLE 2.5 Agenda of a TGC Meeting

When providing notice of a TGC meeting to TGC Members, the Chair of the TGC shall provide an agenda generally stating items to be discussed in that meeting.
The Chair of the TGC or their designee is solely responsible for creating and managing the agenda of each TGC meeting, and distributing it to TGC Members.

No action may be taken or motion passed at any TGC meeting if the adoption of the action or passage of the motion would require more than the majority of Voting TGC Members to agree, unless the subject matter of the proposed action or motion was generally stated in the agenda delivered with the notice of that meeting in accordance with notice requirements in the OSRA Charter, or unless each Voting TGC Member who is not present at the meeting has notified the Chair of the TGC in writing prior to the meeting that the action or motion may be considered and passed.
The Voting TGC Members present at the meeting must unanimously agree to consider the action or motion.

Even if proper notice was given, the Chair of the TGC may postpone (on a “one time” basis) postpone consideration of any action or motion for at least seven (7) additional calendar days upon the written request received prior to the meeting from any Voting TGC Member who is unable to be present at the noticed meeting when such matter was to be first considered.
The Chair of the TGC shall either call an additional meeting of the TGC to consider that matter, or hold an asynchronous vote.

> ℹ️ If an item is not on the agenda of a TGC meeting then the preference is to not discuss or decide it in that meeting.
> Instead, the item should be postponed to the next regularly scheduled TGC or, if it is urgent, a special meeting of the TGC should be called and that item placed on its agenda.

Additional items can be raised during the meeting by any PMC Member, but formal decisions can only be taken if on the agenda prior to the meeting.

Anyone can propose to the Project Leader that an item be added to the agenda of a PMC meeting prior to the notification period, but the Project Leader has sole discretion on whether to include it or not.
